# docker-playground
A Docker Image with multiple languages installed.  Useful as an alternative to creating a bunch of `temp` or `test` files when experimenting with a language.  Simply book up the container and do your code experiments inside it.  Exit the container when done, leaving no files for you to go and clean up later :)
